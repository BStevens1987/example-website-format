# example_website

I used html and css with flexbox to create a formatted example company website. I used generic images and text for filler to emphasize the overall formatting. For a real company website, the text and images would be matched to fit the company details.

There are four formatted sections and one footer at the base. Many different classes have been used to alter text and formatting throughout the page. This is by design, to show off the ability to make many things unique when necessary. If desired, I could easily create a more consistent style throughout that would use less code. I could also add additional features upon request.

The buttons and links are set to show the hand cursor on hover by design. For a real company website, these would be linked to additional webpages. I would enable the links to open new tabs or redirect the current tab based on the company's desires.
