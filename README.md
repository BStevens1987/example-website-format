# example_website

I used html and css with flexbox to create a fully formatted website.

There are four fully formatted sections and one footer at the base. Many different classes have been used to alter text and formatting throughout the page. This is by design to show off the ability to make many things unique when necessary. If desired, I could easily create a more consistent style throughout that would use less code.

The buttons and links are set to show the hand cursor on hover by design. For a real company website, these would be linked to additional webpages. I would enable the links to open new tabs or redirect the current tab based on the company's desires.
